Exercise: Internationalization, Localization and Redis Caching in Flask

Scenario: You are working on a Flask web application for a global e-commerce store. The store has customers from different parts of the world and needs to support multiple languages. The store also has a product catalog that is accessed frequently and needs to be cached for performance.

Objective: Your task is to internationalize the product catalog, localize it to support English and French, and cache the product catalog using Redis.

Instructions:

1. **Setting up Flask Project**

    If you haven't already, set up a new Flask project.

2. **Install Flask-Babel and Flask-Caching**

    Install the `Flask-Babel` and `Flask-Caching` extensions using pip.

3. **Configure Flask-Babel**

    Configure Flask-Babel in your application to support internationalization and localization. Set English as the default language.

4. **Create Product Model**

    Create a `Product` model with the following fields: `name`, `description`, and `price`. Make sure to use the `gettext` function to mark the `name` and `description` fields for translation.

5. **Create Message Files**

    Use the `pybabel` command to extract messages and create message files for English and French.

6. **Translate Messages**

    Translate the `name` and `description` fields of the `Product` model into French.

7. **Compile Message Files**

    Compile the message files into a binary format that Flask can use.

8. **Configure Flask-Caching**

    Configure Flask-Caching to use Redis as the cache backend.

9. **Cache Product Catalog**

    Create a route that retrieves all products from the database. Use the `@cache.memoize()` decorator to cache the product catalog. The cache should expire after 900 seconds (15 minutes).

10. **Test Your Setup**

    Run your Flask development server and access the route that displays the product catalog. Change the language of your application to French and ensure that the product catalog is displayed in French. Also, ensure that the product catalog is being cached by accessing the route multiple times and observing the database queries.

Remember, this exercise and should take you about one hour to complete. Good luck!
