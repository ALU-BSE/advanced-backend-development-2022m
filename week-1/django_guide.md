A step-by-step guide to help learners grasp the concept of Internationalization and Localization in Python Django.

1. **Setting up Django Project**

    First, we need to set up a new Django project. If Django is not installed, you can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

    Then, create a new Django project:

    ```bash
    django-admin startproject myproject
    ```

    Navigate into your new project:

    ```bash
    cd myproject
    ```

    And start a new app:

    ```bash
    python manage.py startapp myapp
    ```

2. **Enable Internationalization**

    Open `myproject/settings.py` and make sure `USE_I18N` is set to `True`:

    ```python
    USE_I18N = True
    ```

    This setting tells Django that you want to enable internationalization of your project.

3. **Define Languages**

    In the same `settings.py` file, define the languages you want to support. For example, to support English and French, you would add:

    ```python
    LANGUAGES = [
        ('en', _('English')),
        ('fr', _('French')),
    ]

    LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'
    ```

    The `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting tells Django what the default language is.

4. **Create Locale Directory**

    Create a directory named `locale` in the root of your Django project. This is where Django will look for translation files:

    ```bash
    mkdir locale
    ```

5. **Configure LOCALE_PATHS**

    In your Django settings file (`myproject/settings.py`), specify the `LOCALE_PATHS` setting. This is a tuple of filesystem directories where Django looks for translation files:

    ```python
    import os

    BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

    LOCALE_PATHS = (
        os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'locale'),
    )
    ```

    In this example, Django will look for translation files in the `locale` directory inside your project's base directory. You can replace `'locale'` with the actual path to your translation files if they are located somewhere else.


6. **Mark Strings for Translation**

    In your views and templates, mark any user-visible string for translation by wrapping it with `gettext` function or its alias `_()`. For example, in a template you might have:

    ```django
    <h1>{% trans "Hello, World!" %}</h1>
    ```

    And in a view:

    ```python
    from django.utils.translation import gettext as _

    def my_view(request):
        output = _("Hello, World!")
        return HttpResponse(output)
    ```

7. **Create Message Files**

    Django uses message files to store the translations. You can create these files using the `makemessages` command. For example, to create a French message file:

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemessages -l fr
    ```

    This will create a `.po` file in the `locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES` directory of your app.

8. **Translate Messages**

    Open the `.po` file and fill in the `msgstr` for each `msgid`. For example:

    ```po
    #: myapp/views.py:5
    msgid "Hello, World!"
    msgstr "Bonjour le monde!"
    ```

9. **Compile Message Files**

    After translating the messages, you need to compile them into a binary format that Django can use. You can do this with the `compilemessages` command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py compilemessages
    ```

10. **Set Locale Middleware**

    Make sure `'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware'` is included in your `MIDDLEWARE` setting and that it is after the `SessionMiddleware`:

    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        ...
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
        ...
    ]
    ```

    This middleware activates the userâ€™s language, as decided by the `get_language()` function.

11. **Internationalize URLs**

    Django allows you to internationalize URLs so that they are appropriately translated. In your `urls.py` file, you can use the `i18n_patterns` function to specify which URLs should be translated:

    ```python
    from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns
    from django.urls import include, path

    urlpatterns = [
         path('i18n/', inlcude('django.conf.urls.i18n'))  # this will give us the set_language function  used in the form
    ]
    
    urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
        prefix_default_language=False,
    )
    ```

    In this example, the URLs for the admin site and `myapp` will be translated based on the active language. The `prefix_default_language=False` argument means that the default language (as specified in your settings file) will not be prefixed to the URL.

12. **Create a Language Selection Form**

    You can create a form that allows users to change the language of the site. In a Django template, you can use the `{% get_current_language %}` and `{% get_available_languages %}` template tags to get the current language and the list of available languages, respectively:

    ```django
    <form action="{% url 'set_language' %}" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <select name="language">
        {% get_current_language as LANGUAGE_CODE %}
        {% get_available_languages as LANGUAGES %}
        {% for lang in LANGUAGES %}
        <option value="{{ lang.0 }}" {% if lang.0 == LANGUAGE_CODE %}selected{% endif %}>
            {{ lang.1 }} ({{ lang.0 }})
        </option>
        {% endfor %}
    </select>
    <input type="submit" value="Change">
    </form>
    ```

    This form, when submitted, will post to the `set_language` view provided by Django, which will change the language and redirect the user to the page they were on.

Remember to load the `i18n` template tag library at the top of your template:

```django
{% load i18n %}
```

13. **Test Your Translations**

    Finally, you can test your translations by changing the language of your Django application. You can do this by appending `/?lang=fr` to the end of the URL.

    For example, if you're running your Django development server locally, you would navigate to `http://localhost:8000/?lang=fr` to see your application in French.

Let's extend the django guide to include Redis:

14. **Install Redis**

    First, you need to install Redis on your system. If you're using Ubuntu, you can do this with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install redis-server
    ```

    If you're using another operating system, you can find the installation instructions on the [Redis website](https://redis.io/download).

15. **Install Django Redis**

    Django Redis is a full-featured Redis cache/session backend for Django. You can install it with pip:

    ```bash
    pip install django-redis
    ```

16. **Configure Django to Use Redis**

    In your Django settings file (`myproject/settings.py`), you need to configure Django to use Redis as the cache backend:

    ```python
    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
            "LOCATION": "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1",
            "OPTIONS": {
                "CLIENT_CLASS": "django_redis.client.DefaultClient",
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    In this example, Django will use Redis running on localhost (`127.0.0.1`) on port `6379`. The number `1` at the end of the `LOCATION` is the database number.

17. **Use Redis in Your Views**

    You can now use Redis in your views to cache data. Here's an example of how you can cache the result of a database query:

    ```python
    from django.core.cache import cache

    def my_view(request):
        data = cache.get('my_data')
        if data is None:
            data = MyModel.objects.all()
            cache.set('my_data', data, 60 * 15)  # cache data for 15 minutes
        return render(request, 'my_template.html', {'data': data})
    ```

    In this example, the view first tries to get the data from the cache. If the data is not in the cache (i.e., `data is None`), it retrieves the data from the database and stores it in the cache for 15 minutes.

18. **Test Your Setup**

    Finally, you can test your setup by running your Django development server and accessing the view that uses Redis. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the data from the cache being used.

Remember, this is a basic guide and there are many more aspects to internationalization and localization in Django, such as handling pluralization, formatting dates and numbers, and translating model fields. You can find more information in the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/i18n/).
