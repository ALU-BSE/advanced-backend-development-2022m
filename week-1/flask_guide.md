A step-by-step tutorial on how to build a simple Flask application that supports Internationalization and Localization using Flask-Babel.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

First, you need to set up your Python environment. If you haven't already, install Python and pip, the Python package installer. Once you have Python and pip installed, you can create a new directory for your project and install Flask and Flask-Babel:

```bash
mkdir flask_i18n
cd flask_i18n
pip install flask flask_babel
```

## Step 2: Creating a Basic Flask Application

Next, let's create a basic Flask application. Create a new file named `app.py` and add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Step 3: Adding Flask-Babel to Your Application

Now, let's add Flask-Babel to our application. Modify your `app.py` file to look like this:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_babel import Babel

app = Flask(__name__)
babel = Babel(app)

@babel.localeselector
def get_locale():
    return request.accept_languages.best_match(['en', 'es'])

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In the above code, we initialize the Babel extension and define a locale selector function. This function is used by Babel to determine the best language to use.

## Step 4: Marking Strings for Translation

Next, let's mark some strings for translation. Modify your `hello` function to look like this:

```python
from flask_babel import _

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return _("Hello, World!")
```

In the above code, we use the `_()` function provided by Flask-Babel to mark the string "Hello, World!" for translation.

## Step 5: Creating Translation Files

Now, we need to create translation files for our marked strings. Flask-Babel uses GNU gettext for this purpose. You can use the `pybabel` command-line tool to extract marked strings and create translation files.

First, extract the marked strings:

```bash
pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot .
```

Next, initialize a language catalog. Replace `es` with the language code for the language you want to translate to:

```bash
pybabel init -i messages.pot -d translations -l es
```

This will create a directory named `translations` with a subdirectory for the specified language. Inside this subdirectory, you'll find a `messages.po` file. This is the file you'll translate.

Open `translations/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po` in a text editor. You'll see the extracted strings and a place for you to put the translation. Translate the string, save the file, and then compile the translations:

```bash
pybabel compile -d translations
```

## Step 6: Testing Your Application

Finally, let's test our application. Run your application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see "Hello, World!" in English. To see it in Spanish, you can change your browser's language settings to prefer Spanish, or you can modify the `get_locale` function to always return `'es'`.


Let's extend our guide to include some basic Redis operations.

## Step 7: Installing Redis and Python Redis Client

First, you need to install Redis on your machine. The installation process varies depending on your operating system. You can find detailed instructions in the [Redis official website](https://redis.io/download).

Once you have Redis installed and running, you can install the Python client for Redis using pip:

```bash
pip install redis
```

## Step 8: Connecting to Redis

Let's modify our Flask application to connect to Redis. Add the following code to your `app.py`:

```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
```

In the above code, we create a Redis connection object that we can use to interact with Redis.

## Step 9: Using Redis in Your Application

Now, let's use Redis in our application. We'll modify our `hello` function to increment a counter in Redis each time it's called:

```python
@app.route('/')
def hello():
    visits = r.incr('counter')
    return _("Hello, World! You have visited this page {} times.").format(visits)
```

In the above code, we use the `incr` method to increment a counter in Redis. We then include the counter value in the response.

## Step 10: Testing Your Application

Finally, let's test our application. Run your application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see a message indicating how many times you've visited the page. Each time you refresh the page, the counter should increase.

That's it! You've built a simple Flask application that supports internationalization, localization, and uses Redis for storing data. Remember, this is a very basic example. Real-world applications would likely use Redis in more complex ways.
